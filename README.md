## Join algorithm
This library uses Augmented Interval List (AIList) data structure to store and effectively 
join intervals in SQL join. The relevant paper is published
[on biorxiv.org](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/593657v1) and the reference 
implementation can be found [on GitHub](https://github.com/databio/AIList/).
